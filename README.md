# Welcome!

Hey I'm Harry McCardell, a 3-rd year, Game Design and Development student at Rochester Insitute of Technology. 
 
I have a strong interest in web development and object-oriented programming languages. My specialty languages are C# and Javascript but I enjoy using C++ as well. Implementing web APIs, data structures, and algorithms are also a big part of what I do.
