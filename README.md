# Welcome!

Hey I'm Harry McCardell! I'm 4th year, Game Design and Development student at Rochester Insitute of Technology. 
 
I have a strong interest in web development and software engineering/game development. My specialty languages are C# and Javascript but I enjoy using C++ as well. Implementing web APIs, data structures, and algorithms are also a big part of what I do.
